# Notes

Info will be added later. This is a clean OC 0.5.5 build for ThinkPad T450s with the native Intel Wi-Fi/BT card. Bluetooth is working natively and using a TPLink Dongle for Wifi for now. 



Everything works except things that needs native wifi. Wired Sidecar works as well. 





Thanks to EchoSpirit for providing the skeleton for the project. I just cleaned it up a little bit.
